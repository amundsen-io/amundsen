class RestApiQuery(BaseRestApiQuery):
    """
    A generic REST API Query that can be joined with other REST API query.
    Major feature of RestApiQuery is the fact that it is joinable with other RestApiQuery.

    Two main problems RestAPIQuery is trying to solve is:
      1. How to retrieve values that I want from the REST API's result. (value extraction)
      2. Most of the cases, one call is not enough. How to join the queries together to get the result that I want?

    On "1" value extraction: RestApiQuery uses JSONPath which is similar product as XPATH of XML.
    https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/

    On "2" join: The idea on joining REST API is the fact that previous query's result is used to query subsequent
    query.

    To bring this into implementation:
      1. It accepts prior RestApiQuery as a constructor -- Decorator pattern
      2. When URL is formed, it uses previous query's result to compute the URL
        e.g: Previous record: {"dashboard_id": "foo"},
             URL before: http://foo.bar/dashboard/{dashboard_id}
             URL after compute: http://foo.bar/dashboard/foo

    With this pattern RestApiQuery supports 1:1 and 1:N JOIN relationship.
    (GROUP BY or any other aggregation, sub-query join is not supported)


    Supports basic HTTP authentication.

    Extension point is available for other authentication scheme such as Oauth.
    Extension point is available for pagination.

    All extension point is designed for subclass because there's no exact standard on Oauth and pagination.

    (How it would work with Tableau/Looker is described in docstring of _authenticate method)

        :param url: URL string. It will use <str>.format operation using record that comes from previous query to
        substitute any variable that URL has.
        e.g: Previous record: {"dashboard_id": "foo"},
             URL before: http://foo.bar/dashboard/{dashboard_id}
             URL after compute: http://foo.bar/dashboard/foo

             {"report_id": "2", "report_name": "second report"}]

        :param skip_no_result: If there's no result from the query, it will skip this record.
        :param json_path_contains_or: JSON Path expression accepts | ( OR ) operation, mostly to extract values in
        different level. In this case, JSON Path will extract the value from first expression and then second,
        and so forth.

        Example:
            JSON result:
            [{"report_id": "1", "report_name": "first report", "foo": {"bar": "baz"}},

        This assumes that most of authentication process can work with updating member variable such as url and params

        For example, Tableau's authentication pattern is that of Oauth where you need to call end point with JSON
        payload via POST method. This call will return one-time token along with LUID. On following calls,
        one time token needs to be added on header, and LUID needs to be used to form URL to fetch information.

        This is why url and params is part of RestApiQuery's member variable and above operation can be done by
        mutating these two values.

        Another Dashboard product Looker uses Oauth for authentication, and it can be done in similar way as Tableau.
