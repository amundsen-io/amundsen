# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.
# Order is important; the last matching pattern takes the most
# precedence.

# These owners will be the default owners for everything in
# the repo. Unless a later match takes precedence,
# @amundsen-io/amundsen-committerswill be requested for
# review when someone opens a pull request.
