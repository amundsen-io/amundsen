# Because the mono-repo has different test suites for each sub-project,
# it is challenging to use Github's required status checks. For example,
# the front-end specifies node tests, and we'd like to gate PR on their passing.
# However, none of the other projects have those tests. Thus, if you require
# the front-end tests to pass, it will be impossible to land non-frontend PRs.
# However, Github helpfully has the behavior where if there are multiple test
# runners with a single name, if any of them fail, the whole PR will fail. Thus
# this file specifies dummy tests that will always pass.

# The matrix specified here must be a superset of the actual tests run. This
# has the unfortunate side effect of making PRs appear like they have more
# coverage than they actually do, but I think it's relatively minor
