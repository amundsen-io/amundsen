          Do you ever miss having a “workshop” to develop new components before
          hooking them with the real data? Look no more, here is the place!
        </p>
        <p>In this environment you can:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Quickly develop new components for using them on Amundsen</li>
          <li>See what components are available already</li>
          <li>Be consistent with the Amundsen styling</li>
          <li>Create manual tests for your components</li>
          <li>
            Avoid the whole syncing thing while developing your presentational
            components
          </li>
          <li>
            Clear the path to eventually move reusable components into the Data
            Product Language (DPL)
          </li>
          <li>Prototype something really quick to show around</li>
        </ul>
      </StorySection>
    </>
