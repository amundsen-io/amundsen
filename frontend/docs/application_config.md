# Application configuration

This document describes how to leverage the frontend service's application configuration to configure particular features. After modifying the `AppConfigCustom` object in [config-custom.ts](https://github.com/lyft/amundsenfrontendlibrary/blob/master/amundsen_application/static/js/config/config-custom.ts) in the ways described in this document, be sure to rebuild your application with these changes.

**NOTE: This document is a work in progress and does not include 100% of features. We welcome PRs to complete this document**

## Announcements Config

Annoncements is a feature that allows to disclose new features, changes or any other news to Amundsen's users.

<img src='img/announcements_feature.png' width='50%' />

To enable this feature, change the `announcements.enable` boolean value by overriding it on [config-custom.ts](https://github.com/amundsen-io/amundsenfrontendlibrary/blob/master/amundsen_application/static/js/config/config-custom.ts#L1). Once activated, an "Announcements" link will be available in the global navigation, and a new list of announcements will show up on the right sidebar on the Homepage.

## Badge Config

Badges are a special type of tag that cannot be edited through the UI.

`BadgeConfig` can be used to customize the text and color of badges. This config defines a mapping of badge name to a `BadgeStyle` and optional `displayName`. Badges that are not defined will default to use the `BadgeStyle.default` style and `displayName` use the badge name with any `_` or `-` characters replaced with a space.

## Custom Logo

1. Add your logo to the folder in `amundsen_application/static/images/`.
2. Set the the `logoPath` key on the to the location of your image.

## Date

This config allows you to specify various date formats across the app. There are three date formats in use shown below. These correspond to the `formatDate`, `formatDateTimeShort` and `formatDateTimeLong` utility functions.

    default: 'MMM DD, YYYY'
    dateTimeShort: 'MMM DD, YYYY ha z'
    dateTimeLong: 'MMMM Do YYYY [at] h:mm:ss a'

## Indexing Optional Resources

In Amundsen, we currently support indexing other optional resources beyond tables.

### Index Users

Users themselves are data resources and user metadata helps to facilitate network based discovery. When users are indexed they will show up in search results, and selecting a user surfaces a profile page that displays that user's relationships with different data resources.

After ingesting user metadata into the search and metadata services, set `IndexUsersConfig.enabled` to `true` on the application configuration to display the UI for the aforementioned features.

### Index Dashboards

Introducing dashboards into Amundsen allows users to discovery data analysis that has been already done. When dashboards are indexed they will show up in search results, and selecting a dashboard surfaces a page where users can explore dashboard metadata.

After ingesting dashboard metadata into the search and metadata services, set `IndexDashboardsConfig.enabled` to `true` on the application configuration to display the UI for the aforementioned features.

## Mail Client Features

Amundsen has two features that leverage the custom mail client -- the feedback tool and notifications.

As these are optional features, our `MailClientFeaturesConfig` can be used to hide/display any UI related to these features:

1. Set `MailClientFeaturesConfig.feedbackEnabled` to `true` in order to display the `Feedback` component in the UI.
2. Set `MailClientFeaturesConfig.notificationsEnabled` to `true` in order to display the optional UI for users to request more information about resources on the `TableDetail` page.

For information about how to configure a custom mail
client, please see this [entry](flask_config.md#mail-client-features) in our flask configuration doc.

## Resource Configurations

This configuration drives resource specific aspects of the application's user interface. Each supported resource should be mapped to an object that matches or extends the `BaseResourceConfig`.

### Base Configuration

All resource configurations must match or extend the `BaseResourceConfig`. This configuration supports the following options:

1. `displayName`: The name displayed throughout the application to refer to this resource type.
2. `filterCategories`: An optional `FilterConfig` object. When set for a given resource, that resource will display filter options in the search page UI.
3. `supportedSources`: An optional `SourcesConfig` object.

#### Filter Categories

The `FilterConfig` is an array of objects that match any of the supported filter options. We currently support a `MultiSelectFilterCategory` and a `SingleFilterCategory`. See our [config-types](https://github.com/lyft/amundsenfrontendlibrary/blob/master/amundsen_application/static/js/config/config-types.ts) for more information about each option.

#### Supported Sources

The `SourcesConfig` can be used for the customizations detailed below. See examples in [config-default.ts](https://github.com/lyft/amundsenfrontendlibrary/blob/master/amundsen_application/static/js/config/config-default.ts).

##### Custom Icons

You can configure custom icons to be used throughout the UI when representing entities from particular sources. On the `supportedSources` object, add an entry with the `id` used to reference that source and map to an object that specifies the `iconClass` for that database. This `iconClass` should be defined in [icons.scss](https://github.com/lyft/amundsenfrontendlibrary/blob/master/amundsen_application/static/css/_icons.scss).

##### Display Names

You can configure a specific display name to be used throughout the UI when representing entities from particular sources. On the `supportedSources` object, add an entry with the `id` used to reference that source and map to an object that specified the `displayName` for that source.

### Table Configuration
To configure Table related features we have created a new resource configuration `TableResourceConfig` which extends `BaseResourceConfig`. In addition to the configurations explained above it also supports `supportedDescriptionSources`.

#### Supported Description Sources
A table resource may have a source of table and column description attached to it. We can customize it by using `supportedDescriptionSources` object which is an optional object. 
This object has `displayName` and `iconPath`, which can be used throughout the UI to represent a particular description source. See example in [config-default.ts](https://github.com/lyft/amundsenfrontendlibrary/blob/master/amundsen_application/static/js/config/config-default.ts).
For configuring new description sources, add an entry in `supportedDescriptionSources` with the `id` used to reference that source and add desired display name and icon for it.

## Issue Tracking Features

In order to enable Issue Tracking set `IssueTrackingConfig.enabled` to `true` to see UI features. Further configuration
is required to fully enable the feature, please see this [entry](flask_config.md#issue-tracking-integration-features)
