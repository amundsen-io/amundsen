# Application configuration

This document describes how to leverage the frontend service's application configuration to configure particular features. After modifying the `AppConfigCustom` object in [config-custom.ts](https://github.com/lyft/amundsenfrontendlibrary/blob/master/amundsen_application/static/js/config/config-custom.ts) in the ways described in this document, be sure to rebuild your application with these changes.

**NOTE: This document is a work in progress and does not include 100% of features. We welcome PRs to complete this document**

## Mail Client Features
Amundsen has two features that leverage the custom mail client -- the feedback tool and notifications. 

As these are optional features, our `MailClientFeaturesConfig` can be used to hide/display any UI related to these features:
1. Set `MailClientFeaturesConfig.feedbackEnabled` to `true` in order to display the `Feedback` component in the UI.
2. Set `MailClientFeaturesConfig.notificationsEnabled` to `true` in order to display the optional UI for users to request more information about resources on the `TableDetail` page.

For information about how to configure a custom mail
client, please see this [entry](flask_config.md#mail-client-features) in our flask configuration doc.
