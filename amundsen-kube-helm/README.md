# Amundsen K8s Helm Charts

Source code can be found [here](https://github.com/amundsen-io/amundsen)

## What is this?

This is setup templates for deploying [amundsen](https://github.com/amundsen-io/amundsen) on [k8s (kubernetes)](https://kubernetes.io/), using [helm.](https://helm.sh/)

## How do I get started?

1. Make sure you have the following command line clients setup:
    - k8s (kubectl)
    - helm
2. Build out a cloud based k8s cluster, such as [Amazon EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/)
3. Ensure you can connect to your cluster with cli tools in step 1.

## Prerequisites

1. Helm 2.14+
2. Kubernetes 1.14+

## Chart Requirements

| Repository | Name | Version |
|------------|------|---------|
| https://charts.helm.sh/stable | elasticsearch | 1.32.0 |

## Neo4j DBMS Config?

You may want to override the default memory usage for Neo4J. In particular, if you're just test-driving a deployment and your node exits with status 137, you should set the usage to smaller values:

``` yaml
config:
  dbms:
    heap_initial_size: 1G
    heap_max_size: 2G
    pagecache_size: 2G
```

With this values file, you can then install Amundsen using Helm 2 with:

``` shell
helm install ./templates/helm --values impl/helm/dev/values.yaml
```

For Helm 3 it's now mandatory to specify a [chart reference name](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/using_helm/#helm-install-installing-a-package) e.g. `my-amundsen`:

``` shell
helm install my-amundsen ./templates/helm --values impl/helm/dev/values.yaml
```

## Other Notes

- For aws setup, you will also need to setup the [external-dns plugin](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/external-dns)
- There is an existing helm chart for neo4j, but, it is missing some features necessary to for use such as:
  - [\[stable/neo4j\] make neo4j service definition more extensible](https://github.com/helm/charts/issues/21441); without this, it is not possible to setup external load balancers, external-dns, etc
  - [\[stable/neo4j\] allow custom configuration of neo4j](https://github.com/helm/charts/issues/21439); without this, custom configuration is not possible which includes setting configmap based settings, which also includes turning on apoc.
