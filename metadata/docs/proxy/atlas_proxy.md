# Atlas Proxy

In order to make the Atlas-Amundsen integration smooth, we've developed a python package, 
[amundsenatlastypes](https://github.com/dwarszawski/amundsen-atlas-types) that has all the required entity definitions along with helper functions needed to make Atlas compatible with Amundsen.

Usage and Installation of `amundsenatlastypes` can be found [here](https://github.com/dwarszawski/amundsen-atlas-types/blob/master/README.md)

Minimum Requirements:
- amundsenatlastypes==1.1.3
- pyatlasclient==1.0.4

### Configurations  

Once you are done with setting up required entity definitions using [amundsenatlastypes](https://github.com/dwarszawski/amundsen-atlas-types), you are all set to use Atlas with Amundsen.
